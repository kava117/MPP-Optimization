### 1) When you approach a research problem, where is the first place you start?
Search for articles using google and ChatGPT

### 2) What is your goal when accomplishing a research project
Informally: to get published,
Formally: to answer a specific question.
She then pivoted to particular challenges with research or roadblocks
she encounters.
- Often times she'll have challenges with simulations not meeting
mathematical values. For example, running a simulation for an exact answer,
then running it for an approximate answer, and aligning the numerical
values to math the exact behavior.

### 3) What do you do when you feel stuck?

### Possible linear algebra applications:
One technique Dr. P mentioned was utilizing Markov Chain/Transition matrix.
However, we would need a more clear question/goal to see if it is applicable.

We looked at the following article I linked:
Evaluation of a Mobile Farmer’s Market Aimed
at Increasing Fruit and Vegetable Consumption in Food
Deserts: A Pilot Study to Determine Evaluation Feasibility
 
After analyzing the article and its contents together, we 
thought a good start would be to make a similiar table using
our data to the article's Table 1. Which goes over survey demographic
information. 
She commented that this would be a very stats heavy research project
as it stands now.
Our conclusion to the talk was that we still need to find 
a clear question/goal as to what UpOrlando wants to solve.
I informed her that this is also an issue we are facing, and are hoping
to get more information/clarity at the campus visit. She offered to continue
giving assistance as we delve deeper into the project, especially if 
we narrow down a mathematical question.
