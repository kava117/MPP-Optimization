[DELETE THIS LATER: everyone please feel free to add whatever you'd like
and make any edits you feel necessary! for the coming up weeks i
will figure out a nicer way to divy up work but i was swamped this
week and completely forgot]

1) In 2–3 sentences, clearly summarize your overall project objective. How has your project goal
evolved since last week? Indicate any updates, refinements, or changes to your goal since the
previous week.

Our project goal is to help UpOrlando optimize their Mobile Prosperity Program's food market.
We are in early project stages, compiling our data and planning potential project directions. Most
importantly, we are creating a list of critical questions for UpOrlando and our project team; their 
answers will clarify questions about data and inform us of the most strategic path forward.

2) What was the most important mathematical idea you encountered this week?

3) Provide a clear and detailed account of the work completed during the past week. This may
include, but is not limited to:
Read the cited article: Cite a specific article and (key points should be part of your weekly
progress presentation)
Mathematical results completed or partially derived. (again, the results are part of your weekly
progress presentation)
Each item listed under section 3 should be precise, please do not use vague statements like, I
read a paper, etc…

[TO BE DELETED: if everyone could please find one paper or article or some something you can
write a lil blurb about so we can fill this section out. it does not have to be anything super
duper fancy, just something that is related to something we've talked about as a group.
no math has been done yet, so don't worry about numbers.]

WEM: A Node Importance Algorithm in Weighted Networks describes a novel method to calcualte
node importance. Our group is uncertain exactly how our final solution will look, but a weighted
graph is possible. The use of WEM could be extraordinarily useful as it runs in linear time, 
and would reduce time spent creating large and complex matrices. 
(Linjie, Chen & Zhao, Na & Li, Jie & Long, Zhen & Jing, Ming & Wang, Jian. (2021). WEM: A Node Importance Algorithm in Weighted Networks. 10.20944/preprints202301.0385.v1.)

4) Describe any difficulties encountered (examples: computational issues, group communication,
math issues) and discussed how your group attempted to solve the problem.



5) Group Contributions: Briefly state each group member’s contribution that week. (The same
people cannot make similar contributions week after week, meaning you cannot always be the
person who read a peer-reviewed journal article and summarize it for your group)



6) How did you meet (in-person or Zoom) and how many times did you meet? Please include
your attendance sheet from your meetings.

We have scheduled meetings for Thursdays during lunch (in-person), and Monday evenings 
after class (digital). All group members attended both meetings.
