1) In 2–3 sentences, clearly summarize your overall project objective. How has your project goal
evolved since last week? Indicate any updates, refinements, or changes to your goal since the
previous week.
2) What was the most important mathematical idea you encountered this week?
3) Provide a clear and detailed account of the work completed during the past week. This may
include, but is not limited to:
Read the cited article: Cite a specific article and (key points should be part of your weekly
progress presentation)
Mathematical results completed or partially derived. (again, the results are part of your weekly
progress presentation)
Each item listed under section 3 should be precise, please do not use vague statements like, I
read a paper, etc…
4) Describe any difficulties encountered (examples: computational issues, group communication,
math issues) and discussed how your group attempted to solve the problem.
5) Group Contributions: Briefly state each group member’s contribution that week. (The same
people cannot make similar contributions week after week, meaning you cannot always be the
person who read a peer-reviewed journal article and summarize it for your group)
6) How did you meet (in-person or Zoom) and how many times did you meet? Please include
your attendance sheet from your meetings.
